# Automating Pneumatic Press Operation for Battery Module Manufacturing

## Executive Summary

Corvus Energy, a pioneering force in the field of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs), embarked on a visionary journey to revolutionize their battery module manufacturing process. At the heart of this initiative was the automation of a crucial pneumatic press station, which had hitherto been manually operated. This capstone project was driven by the desire to enhance operational efficiency, safety, reduce labor dependency, and optimize resource allocation. The project encountered challenges in the form of budgetary constraints and unforeseen events, which necessitated a pragmatic adaptation of the project scope. Consequently, the project's focus shifted towards producing an invaluable documentation package that would serve as a beacon to illuminate the path of retrofitting in the future.

## Introduction

Collaborating seamlessly with Corvus Energy, this year-long capstone project set out to achieve a transformative goal: the complete automation of a pneumatic press station intricately woven into the battery module manufacturing process. With its inception in 2009, Corvus Energy has etched its reputation as a key player in Energy Storage Systems. Catering largely to the maritime sector, the company's focus aligns seamlessly with regulatory compliance and emissions control across diverse global geographies. Notably, Corvus Energy's Energy Storage Systems have become indispensable to over 90% of large commercial hybrid vessels. This project is poised to amplify their manufacturing efficiency by introducing a groundbreaking automated approach to their battery module production.

## System Characterization

Central to Corvus Energy's battery module production process is the pivotal role of a pneumatic press station. This station diligently compresses battery components within thermal compound, facilitating efficient heat extraction during the charging and discharging cycles. This crucial press station was targeted for automation, thereby aiming to optimize the manufacturing process while ensuring consistent quality standards. The preliminary system characterization delved deep into the dynamics of the machinery, enabling a holistic understanding of its functioning and interconnections within the assembly line.

##  Current Manufacturing Capabilities

Visualizing Corvus Energy's manufacturing line is akin to gazing at a radiant starfish, a circular configuration encompassing strategically positioned stations. Each station contributes a unique role in the multi-step assembly of battery modules, reflecting a balance of manual and automated labor. These modules, comprising stacked strings of battery cells, undergo meticulous processing through a circular journey of two distinct passes. The press station, residing at position 5 within this celestial configuration, commands an indispensable role in the sequence. The meticulous orchestration of this assembly line is conducted by a central Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) named StarfishPLC. Operating as the brain of the assembly line, this PLC orchestrates automated tasks and data management while synchronizing the entire production ecosystem.

## Press Station Componentry

At the heart of this transformation lies the press station, its redesign and automation forming the crux of this capstone project. Comprising pneumatic pistons orchestrated by valves, this station bears the responsibility of compressing the battery modules with precision and finesse. The orchestration of this complex process demands a symphony of sensors, regulators, and valves. These components synergistically collaborate to not only execute pressing tasks but also monitor critical parameters, ensuring quality, safety, and reliability.

## Value Proposition

Delving deeper into the motives driving this transformation, it is evident that the value proposition extends far beyond mere automation. A fully automatic system poised to process modules seamlessly without human intervention emerges as the cornerstone. Seamless integration with Corvus Energy's Manufacturing Execution System (MES) adds another layer of value, fostering a seamless flow of information and real-time monitoring. Crucially, this automation initiative is not intended to obliterate manual capabilities. Instead, it embraces the coexistence of manual modes, offering the flexibility to toggle between automated and manual operation. This strategic flexibility extends further, accommodating a diverse array of processing setpoints, safeguarding future scalability and adaptability.

## Proposed Solutions

Navigating the realm of solutions, a meticulously crafted approach emerges as the favored contender. This multifaceted solution revolves around three pivotal components: a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), a Communications Gateway (CG), and the Press Station (PS). These elements dance in harmony, ensuring that each fulfills a distinctive role while cohesively contributing to the realization of the automation vision.

## System Development

Peering into the intricate tapestry of system development, the convergence of hardware and software emerges as the fulcrum of innovation. A symphony of communication protocols, network topology, and software frameworks is meticulously orchestrated to ensure flawless interaction between components. The Communications Gateway (CG) assumes the role of a liaison between the PLC and the MES. A multi-threaded architecture governs the CG's operations, ensuring seamless monitoring, processing, and data exchange. Meanwhile, the PLC stands as the sentinel of the physical realm, translating software commands into tangible actions through precise sensing and actuation.

## Prototyping

The culmination of theoretical ingenuity is unveiled in the form of a tangible prototype, an embodiment of the automated vision. Anchored in a recycled computer case, this prototype exemplifies the integration of hardware and software. The prototype emulates MES interactions, hardware controls, and communication protocols. It provides an early glimpse into the automated future, offering a tangible representation of the project's goals and accomplishments.

## Risk and Safety

In the pursuit of innovation, the project does not shy away from confronting risks head-on. A meticulous Machine Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (MFMEA) was conducted, meticulously evaluating potential failure modes and their potential impact. Safety considerations were integrated into the design, ensuring that operational excellence does not come at the expense of safety.

## Conclusion

As the final chord is struck on this year-long symphony of innovation, the resounding notes of success reverberate. Corvus Energy's visionary quest for automation has yielded tangible results. A meticulously crafted documentation package stands as a guide for future retrofitting endeavors, ushering in an era of enhanced manufacturing efficiency and quality. The pneumatic press station's transformation resonates not only within the assembly line but also within the annals of industrial automation. The collaborative fusion of technical prowess and industrial aspirations has resulted in a crescendo of progress that promises to reverberate far beyond the confines of this capstone project.
